# Image captioning
A model CNN-RNN model to caption images from COCO data set.

## Files Description
* 1. Load and Visualize Data: Load data and pre-process it, normalize, rescale, crop etc.
* 2. Define the Network Architecture.ipynb: Define network architecture, data transormation, training model and test
* 3. Facial Keypoint Detection, Complete Pipeline.ipynb: Face detection, crop RoI and extract facial landmarks using trained model
* 4. Fun with Keypoints.ipynb: Play with extracted landmarks :) add sun glasses to face, blink or wink detection etc.
* model.py: Create model

## Installation
