# Facial Key Points Detection
A model to detect 68 facial key points of human faces.

## Files Description
* **1. Load and Visualize Data**: Load data and pre-process it, normalize, rescale, crop etc.
* **2. Define the Network Architecture.ipynb**: Define network architecture, data transormation, training model and test
* **3. Facial Keypoint Detection, Complete Pipeline.ipynb**: Face detection, crop RoI and extract facial landmarks using trained model
* **4. Fun with Keypoints.ipynb**: Play with extracted landmarks :) add sun glasses to face, blink or wink detection etc.
* **model.py**: Create model
